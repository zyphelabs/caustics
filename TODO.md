### PCR Parity: Whatâ€™s Done vs Remaining

Completed parity

- [x] Field selection optimization wired to SQL (only requested columns fetched)
- [x] Relation-level orderBy/take/skip/cursor/distinct inside include closures
- [x] Distinct emulation via GROUP BY for specific fields (cross-backend)

Remaining gaps
- [x] Nested select/include trees (selecting scalars on included relations; nested includes)
- [x] Relation-level orderBy/take/skip inside include args (e.g., include: { posts: { take: 5, orderBy: ... } })
- [x] Native DISTINCT ON for Postgres (wired via SeaQuery distinct_on with typed columns)
- [ ] Error surface parity (typed errors like RelationNotFetched, QueryValidation) and error messages
- [ ] Raw SQL APIs (`_queryRaw`, `_executeRaw`) and result typing
- [x] Full batch API parity (batch update/delete/upsert builders consolidated)
- [ ] Middlewares/hooks and transaction API parity with PCR
 - [x] JSON null handling flags (DbNull/JsonNull/AnyNull) with `FieldOp::JsonNull`

## Toolchain

- [x] Pin nightly toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml` (nightly-2025-08-31)
- [x] Enable `#![feature(decl_macro)]` where needed for per-entity `pub macro` support

## API changes

- [x] Remove legacy global `Select!` macro and `Vec<ScalarField>` selects
- [x] Remove global `select_typed!` macro from public API; use per-entity `entity::select!(...)`
